# Introduction

These docs have been created using [Gitbook-CLI](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-cli).

To view the docs locally simply install gitbook-cli globally with npm.

`npm i -g gitbook-cli`

Once installed via npm, to run the documentation locally simple run:

`gitbook serve docs`

The command will start gitbooks serving the folder `docs` which is where gitbooks has been setup inside the repo.
